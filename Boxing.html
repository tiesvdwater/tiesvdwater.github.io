      <h1>What is boxing?</h1>
      <p>Boxing is a martial art and combat sport in which two people throw punches at each other, usually with gloved hands. Historically, the goals have been to weaken and knock down the opponent.</p>
      <p>Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores<br>from the judges, the fight is considered a draw.</p>
      <p>While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history, the origin of boxing as<br>an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688. Boxing evolved<br>from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the<br>mid-19th century, again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States.</p>
